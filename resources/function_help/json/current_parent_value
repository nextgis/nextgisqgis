This will differ from the parent feature's actual attribute values for features which are currently being edited or have not yet been added to a parent layer. When used in a value-relation widget filter expression, this function should be wrapped into a 'coalesce()' that can retrieve the actual parent feature from the layer when the form is not used in an embedded context.",
