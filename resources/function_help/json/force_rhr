  "description": "Forces a geometry to respect the Right-Hand-Rule, in which the area that is bounded by a polygon is to the right of the boundary. In particular, the exterior ring is oriented in a clockwise direction and the interior rings in a counter-clockwise direction. Due to the inconsistency in the definition of the Right-Hand-Rule in some contexts it is recommended to use the explicit force_polygon_cw function instead.",
