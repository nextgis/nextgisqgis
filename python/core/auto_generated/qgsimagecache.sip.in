class QgsImageCache : QgsAbstractContentCacheBase
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
A cache for images derived from raster files.

:py:class:`QgsImageCache` stores pre-rendered resampled versions of raster image files, allowing efficient
reuse without incurring the cost of resampling on every render.

:py:class:`QgsImageCache` is not usually directly created, but rather accessed through
:py:func:`QgsApplication.imageCache()`.

.. versionadded:: 3.6
%End

%TypeHeaderCode
#include "qgsimagecache.h"
%End
  public:

    QgsImageCache( QObject *parent /TransferThis/ = 0 );
%Docstring
Constructor for QgsImageCache, with the specified ``parent`` object.
%End

    QImage pathAsImage( const QString &path, const QSize size, const bool keepAspectRatio, const double opacity, bool &fitsInCache /Out/, bool blocking = false, double targetDpi = 96 );
%Docstring
Returns the specified ``path`` rendered as an image. If possible, a pre-existing cached
version of the image will be used. If not, the image is fetched and resampled to the desired
size, and then the result cached for subsequent lookups.

``path`` may be a local file, remote (HTTP) url, or a base 64 encoded string (with a "base64:" prefix).

The ``size`` parameter dictates the target size of the image. An invalid size indicates the
original raster image size (with no resampling). A size in which the width or height is
set to zero will have the zeroed value automatically computed when keepAspectRatio is ``True``.

If ``keepAspectRatio`` is ``True``, then the original raster aspect ratio will be maintained during
any resampling operations.

An ``opacity`` parameter dictates the opacity of the image.

If the resultant raster was of a sufficiently small size to store in the cache, then ``fitsInCache``
will be set to ``True``.

The ``blocking`` boolean forces to wait for loading before returning image. The content is loaded
in the same thread to ensure provided the image. WARNING: the ``blocking`` parameter must NEVER
be ``True`` from GUI based applications (like the main QGIS application) or crashes will result. Only for
use in external scripts or QGIS server.

Since QGIS 3.22 the ``targetDpi`` argument can be used to specify an explicit DPI to render the image
at. This is used for some image formats (e.g. PDF) to ensure that content is rendered at the desired
DPI. This argument is only used when an invalid ``size`` argument is specified. If a valid ``size`` is
specified then the image will always be rendered at this size, regardless of the ``targetDpi``.
%End

    QSize originalSize( const QString &path, bool blocking = false ) const;
%Docstring
Returns the original size (in pixels) of the image at the specified ``path``.

``path`` may be a local file, remote (HTTP) url, or a base 64 encoded string (with a "base64:" prefix).

If ``path`` is a remote file, then an invalid size may be returned while the image is in the process
of being fetched.

The ``blocking`` boolean forces to wait for loading before returning the original size. The content is loaded
in the same thread to ensure provided the original size. WARNING: the ``blocking`` parameter must NEVER
be ``True`` from GUI based applications (like the main QGIS application) or crashes will result. Only for
use in external scripts or QGIS server.

If the image could not be read then an invalid QSize is returned.
%End

  signals:

    void remoteImageFetched( const QString &url );
%Docstring
Emitted when the cache has finished retrieving an image file from a remote ``url``.
%End
